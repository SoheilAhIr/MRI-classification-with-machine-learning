# MRI-classification-with-machine-learning
This project is for MRI classification with machine learning for detecting MCI from AD patients.
The project has two principal codes. The first is for loading MRI T1 data from the ADNI dataset and preprocessing them (ADNI data should be downloaded before).
In the first code white matter part of the brain, MRI is segmented based on the fuzzy c means (FCM) algorithm.
The second part is for feature extraction, dimension reduction, and classification with an ensemble classifier based on KNN, DT, and LDA classifiers.
